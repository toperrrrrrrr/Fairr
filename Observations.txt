Mainpage:
- We can move the quick actions to a more smaller buttons. Grouplist must be what's showing up first. 
- recent transactions can live on the notification page.

Group list page: 
- There is a huge space below the manage recurring. 
- Manage recurring button is too huge, we can make it way smaller and put it somewhere else. Maybe as quick actions as well?

- no option to edit the emoji/icon
- Archive button not working. 
- Add participants placeholder on the group for those that doesnt have account yet which user can invite later on that will fill the slot.

Create group page.

For platform admin and support:
- Track logs, who logged in and actions
