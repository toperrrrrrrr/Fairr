We need to do Feature Completeness review. 

Error list
ERROR : PERMISSION_DENIED: Missing or insufficient permissions


We need to create a more easy way to understand what is happening. Own version of error tracking. like error 404 means something on the internet right. I would like to follow that kind of standard. 

Mainpage:
- This is actually ok. We can improve this later on. Maybe just hide this page.
- We can move the quick actions to a more smaller buttons. Grouplist must be what's showing up first. 
- recent transactions can live on the notification page. 
- 

Group list page: 
- There is a huge space below the manage recurring. 
- Manage recurring button is too huge, we can make it way smaller and put it somewhere else. Maybe as quick actions as well? 
- Manual settlement crashes the app.
- Emoji selected on group cration page is not appearing on the group list reccords 


Group Settings Page:
- no option to edit the emoji/icon
- Archive button not working. 
- Add participants placeholder on the group for those that doesnt have account yet which user can invite later on that will fill the slot. 
- 


Notification page:
- layout is not following the convension. could be improved.
- using fake data. 
- must include transactions
- friend request 
- invites 
- requests to join
-request to pay. 
- New version of the app.


Search Bar Page: 
- Layout needs to be fixed. 


Create group page.
- layout can be improved. 
- group avatar should be material icons, and must be inside a button not on directly show up on the page directly. 
- icons/emoji can be from user's keyboard?
- instead of invite members/ we will create placeholder for the members, where users can invite them 1 by 1. 



After onboarding:
- Ask the user to update their name and details in the settings. 



For platform admin and support:
- Track logs, who logged in and actions 


Login Page: 
- issue with manual email entry. malformed? 


When app loads first
- instead of showing the page without the data. Do not load the page immediately until data is ready. 
- Or preload the data when app starts? 

Settle Up Page: 
ERROR : PERMISSION_DENIED: Missing or insufficient permissions
- This error shows up when I request for payment
- This error also shows up when individual balance is being settled. 


Edit profile page: 
- using fake details of john doe.


Settings page:
- Dark mode is still not working, this setting must be saved to user profile or offline storage so that it doesnt change whenever user uses the app
