# Fairr Project - Training Insights & Best Practices

## Project Overview
Fairr is an Android expense management app built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Firebase. The project follows MVVM architecture with dependency injection using Hilt.

## Key Architectural Patterns Observed

### 1. Data Layer Structure
```
data/
├── auth/           # Authentication services
├── expenses/       # Expense management
├── groups/         # Group management
├── friends/        # Friend management
├── settlements/    # Settlement calculations
├── repository/     # Data repositories
├── model/          # Data models
└── notifications/  # Notification services
```

### 2. UI Layer Structure
```
ui/
├── screens/        # Screen components
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── theme/          # App theming
└── viewmodel/      # ViewModels
```

### 3. Key Technologies & Dependencies
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose with Material 3
- **Architecture**: MVVM with Repository pattern
- **DI**: Hilt for dependency injection
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **Auth**: Firebase Authentication
- **Testing**: JUnit, Mockito, Compose Testing

## Common Development Patterns

### 1. Service Layer Pattern
Services are organized by domain and follow a consistent pattern:
```kotlin
@Singleton
class ExpenseService @Inject constructor(
    private val firestore: FirebaseFirestore,
    private val auth: FirebaseAuth
) {
    suspend fun createExpense(expense: Expense): Result<Expense>
    suspend fun getExpenses(groupId: String): Result<List<Expense>>
    // ... other methods
}
```

### 2. ViewModel Pattern
ViewModels follow a consistent structure with state management:
```kotlin
@HiltViewModel
class ExpenseViewModel @Inject constructor(
    private val expenseService: ExpenseService
) : ViewModel() {
    private val _uiState = MutableStateFlow(ExpenseUiState())
    val uiState: StateFlow<ExpenseUiState> = _uiState.asStateFlow()
    
    fun loadExpenses() {
        viewModelScope.launch {
            _uiState.value = _uiState.value.copy(isLoading = true)
            // ... implementation
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. UI State Management
Consistent UI state patterns using sealed classes:
```kotlin
data class ExpenseUiState(
    val expenses: List<Expense> = emptyList(),
    val isLoading: Boolean = false,
    val error: String? = null
)
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. Icon Deprecation Warnings
**Issue**: Material 3 icons are deprecated and show warnings
**Solution**: Replace deprecated icons with AutoMirrored versions:
```kotlin
// Old (deprecated)
Icon(Icons.Default.ArrowBack, contentDescription = null)

// New (AutoMirrored)
Icon(Icons.AutoMirrored.Default.ArrowBack, contentDescription = null)
```

### 2. Test Compilation Issues
**Issue**: Tests may fail due to missing dependencies or configuration
**Solution**: 
- Ensure all test dependencies are properly configured in `build.gradle.kts`
- Run `./gradlew test` to identify specific issues
- Check for proper test annotations and imports

### 3. Firebase Integration
**Issue**: Firebase services may not be properly initialized
**Solution**:
- Ensure `google-services.json` is properly configured
- Check Firebase initialization in `FairrApplication.kt`
- Verify Firestore rules and indexes

## Development Workflow Insights

### 1. Analysis First Approach
Always start by understanding the current state:
- Review existing TODO lists and documentation
- Examine current implementation patterns
- Identify what's working and what needs improvement

### 2. Incremental Development
- Make small, focused changes
- Test each change thoroughly
- Update documentation as you go
- Keep TODO lists current

### 3. Testing Strategy
- Run tests before making changes
- Write tests for new functionality
- Fix test failures immediately
- Use both unit tests and UI tests

### 4. Documentation Maintenance
- Update TODO lists as items are completed
- Document architectural decisions
- Keep README files current
- Maintain clear commit messages

## Code Quality Standards

### 1. Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive names for functions and variables
- Follow Kotlin naming conventions
- Use consistent naming across similar components

### 2. Error Handling
- Use Result types for operations that can fail
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Handle edge cases gracefully

### 3. State Management
- Use StateFlow for reactive state management
- Keep UI state simple and focused
- Avoid unnecessary state updates

### 4. Testing
- Write tests for business logic
- Test UI components and user flows
- Maintain good test coverage
- Use meaningful test names

## Common Commands

### Build & Test
```bash
# Run all tests
./gradlew test

# Build the project
./gradlew build

# Run specific test class
./gradlew test --tests "com.example.fairr.ui.screens.expenses.AddExpenseViewModelTest"

# Clean and rebuild
./gradlew clean build
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Start with Understanding
Always begin by thoroughly understanding the existing codebase before making changes.

### 2. Test-Driven Development
Write tests first, then implement features. This ensures quality and prevents regressions.

### 3. Incremental Improvement
Make small, focused changes rather than large refactoring efforts.

### 4. Documentation is Key
Keep documentation up-to-date as you make changes. It helps with future development and onboarding.

### 5. Follow Established Patterns
Consistency in code structure and patterns makes the codebase more maintainable.

### 6. Regular Validation
Run tests frequently to catch issues early and ensure code quality.
