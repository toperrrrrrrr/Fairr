- **UI/UX**
  - [ ] Refine the split selection modal in `AddExpenseScreen.kt` to allow:
    - Interactive percentage input for each member.
    - Custom amount entry per member.
    - Real-time validation: total split must match expense amount (see `calculateSplits` in `ExpenseRepository.kt`).
    - Show remaining/unallocated amount or percentage.
    - Display error if over/under-allocated.
  - [ ] Add visual feedback for split type selection (equal, percentage, custom).
- **ViewModel/Logic**
  - [x] Ensure `AddExpenseViewModel.kt` and `ExpenseRepository.kt` handle all split types robustly.
  - [x] Validate splits before saving (client-side and server-side).
  - [x] Persist split type in Firestore (currently only "Equal Split" is shown in detail screen, see TODO in `ExpenseDetailScreen.kt`).

#### 1.1.2 Validate and persist custom splits
- [x] Ensure backend (`ExpenseRepository.kt`) and Firestore rules enforce:
  - Only valid splits are accepted (sum matches total, no negative values).
  - Split details are stored in the `splitBetween` array.

- **ViewModel/Repository**
  - [x] Use `EditExpenseViewModel.kt` to fetch, update, and delete expenses via `ExpenseRepository.kt`.
  - [ ] Ensure Firestore rules (`firestore.rules`) only allow group members (or creator/admin) to edit/delete.
  - [x] Update group totals on edit/delete (see transaction logic in `ExpenseRepository.kt`).
