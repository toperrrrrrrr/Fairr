# Fairr Project Master TODO List - UPDATED

## âœ… RECENTLY COMPLETED (December 2024)

### Codebase Analysis & Documentation
- âœ… Comprehensive 6-phase codebase analysis completed
- âœ… Architecture documentation and recommendations
- âœ… Feature specifications and technical roadmaps

### Expense Management - Real Data Implementation
- âœ… **AddExpenseScreen & AddExpenseViewModel**: Connected to real ExpenseRepository, implemented split validation, error handling
- âœ… **EditExpenseScreen & EditExpenseViewModel**: Fixed placeholder logic, real data loading, proper error handling
- âœ… **ExpenseRepository**: All CRUD operations connected to Firestore, split calculation, real-time sync
- âœ… **Split Calculation**: Comprehensive validation for equal, percentage, and custom amount splits
