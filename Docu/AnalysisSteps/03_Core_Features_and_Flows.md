        .whereArrayContains("memberIds", currentUser.uid)
        .addSnapshotListener { snapshot, error ->
            // Process real-time updates
        }
    awaitClose { subscription.remove() }
}

        else -> calculateEqualSplit(totalAmount, groupMembers)
    }
}
```

**Split Types:**
1. **Equal Split**: Divides amount equally among all members

    "Percentage" -> {
        val providedPercentTotal = groupMembers.sumOf { 
            (it["percentage"] as? Number)?.toDouble() ?: 0.0 
        }
        val percentages = if (providedPercentTotal in 99.9..100.1) {
            // Use given percentages
        } else {
            // Fallback to equal distribution
        }
    }
    "Custom Amount" -> {
        val validSpecifiedTotal = groupMembers.sumOf { member ->
            val customAmount = (member["customAmount"] as? Number)?.toDouble() ?: 0.0
            customAmount.coerceAtLeast(0.0)
        }.coerceAtMost(totalAmount)
        // Distribute remaining amount equally
    }
}
