## üö´ CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

### **Documentation-Only Learning**
- **NO code generation** during learning phase
- **NO assumptions** beyond what's documented
- **NO external research** - work only with provided materials
- **VERIFY understanding** against multiple documentation sources

### **Accuracy Requirements**
- **Cross-reference** information across multiple documents
- **Flag inconsistencies** between documentation areas
- **Distinguish** between actual implementation and proposed improvements
- **Prioritize** recent documentation over older information

### **Depth Requirements**
- **Don't stop at surface level** - understand the "why" behind architectural decisions
- **Connect patterns** across different areas (e.g., how security affects data flow)
- **Understand trade-offs** documented in optimization and problem areas

## üéì SUCCESS CRITERIA

You will have successfully learned the system when you can:

1. **Explain architectural decisions** with specific file references and business justifications
2. **Predict system behavior** in edge cases based on documented patterns
3. **Suggest improvements** that align with documented optimization opportunities
4. **Navigate complexity** by understanding cross-cutting concerns (security, performance, UX)
5. **Generate code** that follows established patterns and conventions
