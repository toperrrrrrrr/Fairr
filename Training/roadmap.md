# Development Roadmap

This document outlines a prioritized roadmap for implementing the UI/UX enhancements identified in the `areas_for_improvement.md` document. The roadmap is divided into three phases: High Priority, Medium Priority, and Future Enhancements.

## Phase 1: High Priority (Core Usability & Accessibility)

These items should be addressed in the next development cycle as they have a significant impact on the core user experience and accessibility of the application.

- **1. Implement First-Time User Onboarding**
  - **Goal**: Create a user walkthrough to introduce key features.
  - **Rationale**: Improves user retention and ensures users understand how to use the app's core functionalities from the start.

- **2. Enhance Accessibility**
  - **Goal**: Ensure all interactive elements have content descriptions, support dynamic font scaling, and pass accessibility audits.
  - **Rationale**: Makes the app usable for a wider audience, including users with disabilities, and is a critical aspect of modern app development.

- **3. Improve Responsiveness for Large Screens**
  - **Goal**: Add explicit support for tablets and foldables with adaptive layouts.
  - **Rationale**: With the growing variety of device form factors, ensuring the app looks and works well on larger screens is crucial for a good user experience.

- **4. Provide Better Contextual Feedback**
  - **Goal**: Expand on user feedback, especially for failed actions (e.g., explaining why a network request failed).
  - **Rationale**: Reduces user frustration and helps users troubleshoot issues on their own.

## Phase 2: Medium Priority (Experience Refinements)

These items refine the user experience, making the app feel more polished and professional.

- **1. Implement Undo/Redo Functionality**
  - **Goal**: Allow users to undo destructive actions like deleting an expense or a group.
  - **Rationale**: Increases user confidence and prevents accidental data loss.

- **2. Improve Navigation**
  - **Goal**: Implement deep linking and improve back stack management.
  - **Rationale**: Allows for more seamless integration with system features like notifications and improves the predictability of navigation.

- **3. Refine Visual Hierarchy and Animations**
  - **Goal**: Differentiate primary/secondary actions more clearly and add subtle animations for transitions.
  - **Rationale**: Enhances the visual appeal and perceived performance of the app, making it more intuitive and enjoyable to use.

## Phase 3: Future Enhancements (Personalization & Theming)

These items are "nice-to-have" features that can be implemented in the long term to further enhance user engagement.

- **1. Add Personalization Options**
  - **Goal**: Allow users to customize their dashboard, reorder tabs, or pin favorite groups.
  - **Rationale**: Gives users more control over their experience and can increase engagement.

- **2. Introduce Custom Themes**
  - **Goal**: Offer alternative themes, such as color-blind modes or different font choices.
  - **Rationale**: Complements accessibility efforts and allows for greater user customization.
