# Items for Review and Action

This document lists observations and action items that require further attention to ensure the consistency and completeness of both the Fairr application and its documentation.

## 1. Confirm Dependency Injection Framework

- **Observation**: The architecture follows MVVM, but a specific dependency injection framework (like Hilt or Koin) is not explicitly mentioned in the project documentation.
- **Action**: Verify which, if any, DI framework is being used. Update the `coding_conventions.md` and `architecture_deep_dive.md` documents to reflect this, and ensure the testing strategy aligns with the chosen framework.

## 2. Detail the Offline Support Strategy

- **Observation**: The `README.md` mentions Room for offline support, but the Room dependencies are not included in the project and no database implementation was found. Offline support is a planned feature, not a current one.
- **Action**: Implement the Room database for local caching. This involves adding the dependencies, defining the database and entities, and updating the data layer to handle local data sources. Once implemented, the documentation should be updated accordingly.

## 3. Validate Data Models and Schema

- **Observation**: All core data models (`UserProfile`, `Group`, and `Expense`) have now been successfully validated against the codebase. The `data_models_and_schema.md` document is accurate.
- **Action**: (Completed)

## 4. Formalize UI/UX Improvement Plan

- **Observation**: The `areas_for_improvement.md` document lists several key enhancements.
- **Action**: (Completed) A prioritized plan has been created in `roadmap.md`.

## 5. Specify Technical Details for Receipt Management

- **Observation**: The technical details for the receipt management feature needed to be specified.
- **Action**: (Completed) A technical specification has been created in `feature_spec_receipt_management.md`.

## 6. Conduct a Full UI Component Audit

- **Observation**: The `ui_component_library.md` was incomplete.
- **Action**: (Completed) A full audit of the `ui/components` directory has been performed, and the `ui_component_library.md` has been updated to be a comprehensive reference.
