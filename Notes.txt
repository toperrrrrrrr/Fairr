2. Notification page cards ui can be improved.
3. Nav bar have huge white space make the oblong and the buttons float. 
4. Need to review the process from creation of group, recording of group, how expnses is being recorded. inviting members, recording of who paid for the expense the split, and the settlement. We need to make sure that every step of the process and data is conncted to one another to make sure that the data reflecting is correct. 
5 .The group details doesnt update the latest expense list after saving the add expense. 
6. remove member in the group settings doesnt work. 
7. Edit group doesnt work either.

11. Keyboard should collapse, be hidden when calcultor is clicked or outside the textbox. 
12. Remove member should ask the user if the user is sure. Also notify the removed user. 
13. Remove the settins button on the main page. Replace with something else 
15. sign out should clear the app and prompt the user to select account next time. 






We can go multiple passes if needed. 
Please focus on analyzing the codebase. 
Dont write code, focus on writing document to help you understand the project. 
Create a step by step process for how you will analyze the project. 
Create a new folder inside the @Docu folder for steps and phase of analyzing
Let me know how many passes you need and I will ask you to continue whenever you timeout or finish with the current pass


You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing a codebase. Your goal is to understand the project deeply and document your findings to assist with future development, onboarding, and refactoring. Follow these instructions:
General Instructions
Do not write or modify any code during this process.
Focus on writing documentation that helps you (and others) understand the project.
Structure your analysis as a step-by-step process with clear phases and goals for each pass.
For each phase, create a new document inside a dedicated folder within the @Docu directory (e.g., @Docu/AnalysisSteps/).
At the end of each pass, summarize your findings and outline the next steps.
Wait for my instruction before proceeding to the next pass.
Step-by-Step Process
Initial Survey
List and describe the main directories and files.
Identify the primary entry points and architectural patterns.
Note any documentation, README, or onboarding files.
High-Level Architecture
Map out the main modules, services, and data flow.
Identify key dependencies and external integrations.
Document the overall structure (e.g., using diagrams or bullet points).
Core Features and Flows
Identify and describe the core features and user flows.
Map out how major features are implemented and interconnected.
Detailed Component/Module Analysis
Dive deeper into each major component or module.
Document responsibilities, key classes/functions, and relationships.
Data Models and Persistence
Analyze data models, schemas, and storage mechanisms.
Document how data is created, read, updated, and deleted.
Testing and Quality
Review the testing strategy, test coverage, and quality assurance practices.
Note any gaps or areas for improvement.
Build, Deployment, and Configuration
Document the build process, deployment pipeline, and configuration files.
Areas for Improvement
Identify technical debt, code smells, or areas for refactoring.
Suggest improvements for documentation, structure, or practices.
Output Format
For each phase, create a new markdown file in @Docu/AnalysisSteps/ (e.g., 01_Initial_Survey.md).
Use clear headings, bullet points, and diagrams where helpful.
Summarize findings and next steps at the end of each document.
Workflow
After each phase, notify me and wait for approval before continuing.
If you reach a timeout or need to pause, summarize your progress and wait for my instruction to proceed.
