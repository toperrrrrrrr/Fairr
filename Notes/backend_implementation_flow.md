# Backend Implementation Flow for Fairr App

This file provides a step-by-step flow for implementing the backend for the Fairr app. It is designed to help you tackle backend development in a logical, manageable sequence, ensuring all critical features and integrations are covered.

---

## 1. **Project Setup & Core Decisions**
- [ ] Choose backend stack (e.g., Firebase, Supabase, Node.js + Express, Django, etc.)
- [ ] Set up project repository and environment variables
- [ ] Define API structure (REST, GraphQL, RPC)
- [ ] Set up authentication method (email/password, OAuth, etc.)

## 2. **Database Design**
- [ ] Identify main entities: Users, Groups, Expenses, Notifications, Settings, etc.
- [ ] Design database schema (ERD)
- [ ] Set up database (Firestore, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- [ ] Implement migrations or schema enforcement

## 3. **Authentication & User Management**
- [ ] Implement user registration and login endpoints
- [ ] Secure password storage and validation
- [ ] JWT/session management
- [ ] Password reset and email verification
- [ ] User profile endpoints (fetch/update profile)

## 4. **Groups & Membership**
- [ ] Endpoints to create, join, leave, and delete groups
- [ ] Group invitation/join code logic
- [ ] Fetch group details, members, and permissions
- [ ] Group roles and permissions (admin, member, etc.)

## 5. **Expense Management**
- [ ] Endpoints to add, edit, delete, and fetch expenses
- [ ] Expense categories and tagging
- [ ] Split logic (who owes what, balances)
- [ ] Attachments (e.g., photo receipts)
- [ ] Expense comments/notes

## 6. **Settlements & Payments**
- [ ] Calculate balances and suggested settlements
- [ ] Record settlements/payments between users
- [ ] Settlement history endpoints

## 7. **Notifications**
- [ ] Push notification integration (FCM, OneSignal, etc.)
- [ ] In-app notification endpoints (new expense, group invite, etc.)
- [ ] Notification preferences per user

## 8. **Settings & Preferences**
- [ ] Endpoints for user/app settings (theme, currency, etc.)
- [ ] Privacy and security settings

## 9. **Analytics & Reporting**
- [ ] Endpoints for group/expense analytics
- [ ] Export data (CSV, PDF)

## 10. **Support, Help & Feedback**
- [ ] Endpoints for help articles, FAQs
- [ ] User feedback submission

## 11. **Testing & Documentation**
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for all endpoints
- [ ] API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI, Postman, etc.)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD for backend deployment

## 12. **Deployment & Monitoring**
- [ ] Deploy backend (cloud, VPS, serverless)
- [ ] Set up logging and monitoring
- [ ] Backups and disaster recovery

---

## 13. **Offline-First Support**
- [ ] Choose a local storage solution (e.g., SQLite, Room, Realm, or encrypted file storage for sensitive data)
- [ ] Implement local data caching for all core entities (Users, Groups, Expenses, etc.)
- [ ] Queue user actions (create/edit/delete) while offline
- [ ] Detect network state and trigger sync when reconnected
- [ ] Design conflict resolution strategy (last-write-wins, merge, or user prompt)
- [ ] Ensure seamless UX: show offline state, pending sync indicators, and error handling
- [ ] Test offline/online transitions and sync reliability

## Suggested Implementation Flow
1. **Set up project, environment, and database.**
2. **Implement authentication and user management.**
3. **Develop group and membership logic.**
4. **Build expense and settlement features.**
5. **Add notifications and settings.**
6. **Layer in analytics, reporting, and support.**
7. **Add offline-first support and test thoroughly.**
8. **Test, document, and deploy.**

**Tip:**
- Tackle one module at a time. Test endpoints with tools like Postman or Insomnia as you go.
- Keep API and database documentation up to date.
- Use version control and commit frequently.
