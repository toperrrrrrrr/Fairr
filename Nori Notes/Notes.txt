1. Groups items on the grouplist doesnt reflect the selected emoji on the logo/avatar. It is only showing the first letter of the title on the main page dashboard and group icon on the group list page
Let's fix it to reflect the emoji instead of the letter. I will then run the app on android studio to check if there is error. 
2. Get the app to load the necessary data first. to prevent the app to show no data where there is actual data. 
3. Improve the friends page. Add friend section should be inside a modal to keep the screen clean. 
4. Friend groups crashes the app. 
5. Friend request should show up on notification page.
6. notifuication page layoutn doesnt follow ui conventions. Also doesnt have correct data. 
7.
