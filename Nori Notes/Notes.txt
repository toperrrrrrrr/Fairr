1. Groups items on the grouplist doesnt reflect the selected emoji on the logo/avatar. It is only showing the first letter of the title on the main page dashboard and group icon on the group list page
Let's fix it to reflect the emoji instead of the letter. I will then run the app on android studio to check if there is error. 
2. Get the app to load the necessary data first. to prevent the app to show no data where there is actual data. 
3. Improve the friends page. Add friend section should be inside a modal to keep the screen clean. 
4. Friend groups crashes the app. 
5. Friend request should show up on notification page.
6. notifuication page layoutn doesnt follow ui conventions. Also doesnt have correct data. 
7. settings blocked users can be removed as we dont need to block users. 
8. 
9. Group details page got huge white screen under manage recurring. 
10. 
11.Reduce code warnings
12. darkmode on some pages doesnt seem right, icons are still black and not changing to white. Notification and settings are not changing to darkmode.
13. Notifications are not appearing on the notification page. Friend request must show up on notificat
Friends should have profile page where we can see their bank details and how much we owe them or how much they owe us
 
Notification doesnt reload to load new notifications

Join group only accepts number but invite code has letter. We should follow only numbers.
